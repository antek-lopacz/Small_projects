Several small projects in Python created for fun and stimulation of my gray cells. I did not use tutorials.

# Pig dice game
Pig is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game. A word is randomly selected from a list, and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
